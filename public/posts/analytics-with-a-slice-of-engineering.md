title: "Analytics With a Slice of Engineering"

I'm currently looking for a job in the data analytics field and most of the jobs
I come across for a data analyst have this requirement "Experience in developing dashboards".

At first glance I thought it had to do with being able to use PowerBI which I had been taught in school and had a few projects under my belt but alas was I wrong. A few youtube videos and a chat with a senior colleague made me realise what that line meant "We need someone with data engineering skills".

I had read a book on data engineering previously, [***Fundamentals of data engineering by Joe Reis and Matt Housley***](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fundamentals-Data-Engineering-Robust-Systems/dp/1098108302/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6TLe88jfsNi0DcK3_6W7CMQn5sd2awQ6WxXcDv-4dgf3uFmPgqEztr2XJUj-uGRt7LoJxTtFdPDm_tUn9izKE8I5ybDDuovCMfIg3ZsguWmYQzJeJsycqtBq_6n8Ou3ZlHIlA5kvX3opDcCpePeWR_qezZSJh75eRgF_0POssSuhYhQMmCr3Qm6r3OcBt_3twt0Wo-TrotO8Y5_ZfASMVBU6K5M372QIPb-ik0tDwkk.N_0PzsHo2REGol0NFqy4JsN82PdCd4XaLZl0zvdF7Ds&qid=1711134727&sr=8-3) so I was a bit familiar with what the role entailed but it wasn't something I thought I would need to know in depth. However, the job market had other
plans. So now learning of the new requirements it's back to the drawing board of skill enhancement.

Unfortunately, I don't have Â£30,000 in the corner to go back for another masters. Therefore the next best alternative is Youtube University where I have found a bootcamp on data engineering by DataTalks Club (Shoutout to the team you're changing lives and saving bank accounts). You can check out their courses [here](https://datatalks.club/articles.html).

I've gone through the introductory video and it is quite impressive what is going to be covered during the course. From using Docker all the way to Google BigQuery, dbt, and Spark. Placing it side by side with the job descriptions I come across, I believe I will be 100% ready to display my ability to do the jobs I apply for.

### Sidenote: 
I'm thinking of using the data from my dissertation as the project I use to solidify my skills in these new tools.
