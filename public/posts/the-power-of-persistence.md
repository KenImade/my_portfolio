*At first, I wanted to write about something programming or data analytics related 
as the first post on my website. However, I changed my mind and decided I would rather start with something else with a more universal application to whoever reads it so here it goes...*

*These are a few of the points I made in my journal while reading Chapter 9 of the book "Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill. I hope as you read (especially future me) you'll
remember why you do what you do*

Persistence is an essential factor in the procedure of changing desire into its monetary
equivalent. The basis of persistence is the power of will.

Men/Women who accumulate great fortunes are generally known as cold blooded and sometimes
ruthless. Often they are misunderstood. What they have is will power, which they mix with
persistence, and place back of their desires to insure the attainment of their objectives.

# ***"There is no substitue for persistence."***

If one does not possess persistence, one does not achieve noteworthy success in any calling.

Persistence is based upon
1. Definiteness of purpose: A strong motive forces ones to surmount many difficulties.
2. Desire: It is comparatively easy to acquire and to maintain persistence in pursuing the object of intense desire.
3. Self-Reliance: Belief in one's ability to carry out a plan encourages one to follow the plan through with persistence.
4. Definiteness of Plans: Organized plans, even though they may be weak and entirely impractical encourage persistence.
5. Accurate Knowledge: Knowing that one's plans are sound, based upon experience or observation, encourages persistence, "guessing" instead of "knowing" destroys persistence.
6. Co-operation: Sympathy, understanding and harmonious co-operation with others tends to develop persistence.
7. Will-power: the habit of concentrating one's thoughts upon the building of plans for the attainment of a definite purpose, leads to persistence.
8. Habit: Persistence is the direct result of habit. The mind absorbs and becomes a part of the daily experience upon which it feeds.

### Symptoms of lack of persistence
1. Failure to recognize and to clearly define exactly what one wants.
2. Indecision, the habit of "passing the buck" on all occasions, instead of facing issues squarely.
3. The habit of relying upon alibies insteas of creating definite plans for the solution of problems.
4. Self satisfaction. There is but little remedy for this affliction, and no hope for those who suffer from it.
5. Indifference, usually reflected in one's readiness to compromise on all occassions, rather than meet opposition and fight it.
6. The habit of blaming others for one's mistakes, and accepting unfavourable circumstances as being unavoidable.
7. Weakness of desire dure to neglect in the choice of motives that impel action.
8. Willingness, even eagerness, to quit at the first sign of defeat.
9. Lack of organized plans, placed in writing where they may be analyzed.
    - The habit of neglecting to move on ideas, or to grasp opportunity when it presents itself.
    - Wishing instead of willing.
10. The habit of compromising with poverty instead of aiming at riches. General abscence of ambition to be, to do, and to own.
11. Searching for all the shortcuts to riches, trying to get without giving a fair equivalent, usually reflected in the habit of gambling, endeavouring to drive "sharp" bargains.
12. Fear of crticism, failure to create plans and to put them into action, because of what other people will think, do, or say.

# ***"Countless number of men and women, both young and old, permit relatives to wreck their lives in the name of duty, because they fear criticism."***

Duty does not require any person to submit to the destruction of his personal ambitions and the right to live his/her own life in his/her own way.

Most ideas are stillborn and need the breadth of life injected into them through definite plans of immediate action.

The time to nurse and idea is at the time of its birth.

The fear of crticism is at the bottom of the destruction of most ideas which never reach the planning and action stage.

If one has persistence, one can get along very well without many other qualities.

# ***"Riches do not respond to wishes, they respond only to definite plans, backed by definite desires, through constant persistence."***

### How to develop persistence
1. A definite purpose backed by burning desire for its fufillment.
2. A definite plan, expressed in continous action.
3. A mind closed tightly against all negative and discouraging influences, including negative suggestions of relatives, friends, and acquaintances.
4. A friendly alliance with one or more persons who will encourage one to follow through with both plan and purpose.

**These are the steps by which one may control one's economic destiny.**

**They are the steps that lead to freedom and independence of thought.**

**They are the steps that lead to riches, in small or great quantities.**

**They lead also to the mastery of fear, discouragement, and indifference.**
