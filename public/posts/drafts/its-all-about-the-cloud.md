Embarking on my data engineering upskill journey, I delved into the cloud's expanse yesterday, an area I'm somewhat familiar with. My previous dalliances with cloud technology left me confident, or so I thought. Setting up a Google Cloud instance? Check. SSH access from my command line? No sweat. Installing stalwarts like Python and Anaconda, and even setting up a PostgreSQL server felt like second nature. Using Docker and Terraform, I'm sorry but what are those?

As I dove deeper, guided by my instructor Alexey, Docker and Terraform started to come into focus. You see, Docker is like a magical suitcase, allowing you to pack everything your code needs to run smoothly. So, when you hand over your code to someone else, they can just 'unpack' it with Docker, and voila, it works exactly as it should, no missing socks! And then there's Terraform, which is kind of like writing a shopping list for your codeâ€™s house. Need databases? Just jot them down in your Terraform list, and it sets up the whole infrastructure, making sure your code has a nice place to live.
